Although having a front-end website alongwith a facebook messenger bot might have been considered enough platform coverage, our team felt that certain user needs could only be fulfilled via a mobile app. Indeed, the goal here was not to simply port our website on to the mobile platform -- it was to instead fulfill certain user needs that could not be reached otherwise. 

Specifically, the emphasis on real-time geolocation / location tracking (via Apple Maps integrations) meant that the mobile app achieved peak synchronization with user movements. Along with the messenger bot and website, the iOS companion app hopefully delivers a fully immersive experience for anyone touring Dartmouth.

## Development: 

Although this will be expanded upon later, for now it suffices to say that I developed this app with the aid of the excellent Ignite starter-kit. I'm a big fan of some of their underlying tech choices; at the very least, using Ignite prevents several annoying npm-installs. 

The main restriction to coding this app from scratch was time -- as our team was already maintaining multiple disparate platforms, we needed to ration time. One may think that using the Ignite starter-kit may not be *that* time efficient considering the current state of the Ignite project (the starter code they give you could be made more user-friendly -- as I discussed with the founder in [this](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/issues/150#issuecomment-241232328) github issue). Still, I found Ignite to be a net positive, and would recommend it to anyone.
